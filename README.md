### Getting Started
Want to contribute? Great!

**Be sure to have [Node][node] installed.**

Open terminal in root directory of project.

Install dependencies with:
```sh
$ npm install
```
Or alternatively with:
```sh
$ npm i
```

Start development with dev-{yourOS} script (defined in package.json).
```sh
$ npm run dev-windows
$ npm run dev-linux
```
You may receive an error when first running the development scripts. If so, restart the scripts.

The development server should now be live at http://localhost:3000
