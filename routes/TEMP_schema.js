Any new top news, upcoming event, and project updates will be posted to our site for everyone to view. My vision in this website is for everyone, members, programmers, and potental members to stay informed about progress and details in every project. Members and potental members can comment and give feedback to any project as a comment feed in each project. Each project contains a detailed description about goals, requirments, and the platform as well as images, list of participating members, and a timeline of events and achivements. As for members, a club member can create a profile and fill in a picture, short and long bios, and show off any work done outside of the club. Quick links will show all of the projects, listed on the website, each member has participated in. As for the About and Contact Us pages, egeryone will have the opprotunuty to ask how to join the club and learn about what we do.',

		'Began programming since GameMaker was installed on the computer of my 8th grade English class. Made a game from complete scratch and messing around with my friends watching me make a face follow the cursor then something shooting at the face! And this is how Face Game was made, a simple concept turned into something amusing. This game was a hit for too many students during English D: But I expanded to the iPhone, the Mac World! And I\'ll never go back, to PC *cough*. I planned to recreate the Face Game on the iOS with all new faces and cooler stuff because it\'s on the phone. Butt I was too intrested in making other iOS apps and created a few utilities enough to make myself noticed for a client. I programmed and designed an application for a client, George Moskoff. George was the sole creator of Kids-Self Evaluation. This app is sold on the iPhone AppStore. I learned to making my own apps to sell on the AppStore, Mulah, iLogs, Assigned, and whatever else comes out of my head :)',
